# CIR-DE
 CIR-DE: A chaotic individual regeneration mechanism for solving the stagnation problem in differential evolution

In terms of the proposed framework, we have shared the code of the CIR framework, which is implemented on the the classical SHADE algorithm.

In addition, we have also shared the review process of our paper, which included the reviewer's comments and our responses.
